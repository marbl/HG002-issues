# HG002-issues

Welcome to the HG002-issues repository, where we'll track the status of
issues in the latest version of the verkko-derived assembly of HG002.
If you are a polisher, you can view the list of issues [here](https://github.com/marbl/HG002-issues/issues).
There are also PDF documents describing our approach to different types of issues, 
as well as descriptions and URLs for the data available to polishers [here](https://github.com/marbl/HG002-issues/manuals).
